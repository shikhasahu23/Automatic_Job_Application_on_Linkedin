Getting Started!
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites - 
1.Install selenium. I used pip to install the selenium package.
pip install selenium
1.Selenium requires a driver to interface with the chosen browser. Make sure the driver is in your path, you will need to add your driver_path to the config.json file.
I used the Chrome driver, you can download it here. You can also download Edge, Firefox or Safari. Depends on your preferred browser.

Usage -
Fork and clone/download the repository and change the configuration file with:
Your email linked to LinkedIn.
Your password.
Keywords for finding specific job titles fx. Machine Learning Engineer, Data Scientist, etc.
The location where you are currently looking for a position.
The driver path to your downloaded webdriver.
Run python main.py.
